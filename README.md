# git-notify

_Communicate important updates to your team via git commit messages_.

## What is git-notify?

Sometimes you need to communicate changes to other developers on your project. In a small team, a Slack message works okay, but in larger teams and distributed organizations (such as open source projects), reaching everyone can be a pain.

`git-notify` allows you to embed announcements into your git commit messages:

```sh
git commit -m 'git-notify: NEW DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ...'
```

And display them to another developer on a machine, far far away:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jevakallio/git-notify/master/docs/demo_animated.gif" alt="Demo"></img>

Simple as that.

## How to use git-notify?

Just add `"git-notify:"` to your git commit message, and anything that follows will be displayed when another developer pulls that commit, or switches from a branch that does not contain that commit to one that does.

If you're using a merge or squash commit strategy on GitHub, you can also add them to the extended commit message when landing a PR:

## Getting Started

Install `git-notify` to your `npm` (or `yarn`) based project as a devDependency:

```bash
# using npm
npm install --save-dev git-notify

# using yarn
yarn add -D git-notify
```

Next, we'll configure `git-notify` to run automatically when other developers pull commits that contain git messages. Below we show how to achieve this with the excellent [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook#lefthook) libraries. For other approaches, see the [Git Hooks](#git-hooks) section later in this document.

### Installing hooks with husky

```
# using npm
npm install --save-dev husky@4

# using yarn
yarn add -D husky@4
```

Configure `git-notify` hooks by adding the following `husky` entries to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  //...snip
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "post-merge": "git-notify merge $HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS",
      "post-rewrite": "git-notify rewrite $HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS",
      "post-checkout": "git-notify checkout $HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
    }
  }
}
```

_**Note:** The above instructions below are for [husky v4.x](https://github.com/typicode/husky/tree/master). Husky v5 has changed how hooks are configured, as well updated its licensing terms to be free only to other open source projects.See [husky's own documentation](https://dev.to/typicode/what-s-new-in-husky-5-32g5) for how to configure hooks in their latest version._

### Installing hooks with lefthook

```
# using npm
npm install --save-dev @arkweid/lefthook

# using yarn
yarn add -D @arkweid/lefthook
```

Configure `git-notify` hooks by adding the following entries to your `lefthook.yml`:

```yaml
post-merge:
  commands:
    notify:
      run: "npx git-notify merge {0}"
post-rewrite:
  commands:
    notify:
      run: "npx git-notify merge {0}"
post-checkout:
  commands:
    notify:
      run: "npx git-notify merge {0}"

```

## Configuration

- `git-notify --prefix "@everyone"`
  - Change the prefix `git-notify` looks for in git commit messages
  - Default: `git-notify:`
- `git-notify --color "#ff6f6f"`
  - Change the color of the banner or message
  - This can be one of the [`chalk` preset colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk#colors) or a hex value. Note that not all terminals support full hex color scales.
- `git-notify --simple`
  - Instead of a fancy banner, displays a simple text message

### All parameters

Run `npx git-notify --help` for an up to date list of parameters:

```sh
npx git-notify --help

  Usage
    $ git-notify <method> [options] $GIT_PARAMS

   Methods
     since <commit>  show all notifications since commit
     merge           run on git pull/merge
     rewrite         run on git rebase
     checkout        run on git checkout/switch

  Options
     --prefix, -p    prefix to  look for in commit messages (default: "git-notify:")
     --simple, -s    show a plain, unboxed notification
     --color, -c     color of displayed notification

  Examples
     $ git-notify since HEAD~5
     $ git-notify checkout $GIT_PARAMS
```

## About formatting

`git-notify` will display a message for every "git-notify:" prefix it finds in the commit log that was just pulled/merged/rebased/checked out. **The notification message will be the rest of the paragraph following the prefix.**

For example, this commit message:

```
This change upgrades some of our dependencies. git-notify: Please run npm install
```

Will print:

```
            ╒════════════════════════════╕
            │                            │
            │  Please run npm install    │
            │                            │
            ╘════════════════════════════╛
```

The message will run until the end of the paragraph, delimited by a double line break. Single line breaks and other whitespace will be preserved. So that:

```
Rewrite everything.

git-notify:EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED
This project has been rewritten
from scratch. If something broke,
please contact Jeff at dev@null.com.

May god please forgive me.
```

Will display:

```
         ╒══════════════════════════════════════════╕
         │                                          │
         │          EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED          │
         │     This project has been rewritten      │
         │    from scratch. If something broke,     │
         │   please contact Jeff at dev@null.com.   │
         │                                          │
         ╘══════════════════════════════════════════╛
```

You can run `git-notify since` to test configuration and dry-run the message you've just created locally. For example:

```
git commit -m '@team what's up??'
npx git-notify since HEAD~1 --prefix "@team"
```

### Can I group messages

Not at the moment, but this should not be difficult to add. See [Contributing](#contributing)

## Git Hooks

### Installing with husky

See [Installing hooks with husky](#installing-hooks-with-husky) in the Getting Started section.

### Installing with lefthook

See [Installing hooks with lefthook](#installing-hooks-with-lefthook) in the Getting Started section.

### Installing hooks by any other means

`git-notify` is agnostic to however you want to install your git hooks.

The hooks you need to configure are:

- **post-merge** (runs on `git pull` and `git merge`)
  - `npx git-notify merge $GIT_PARAMS`
- **post-rewrite** (runs on `git rebase`)
  - `npx git-notify rewrite $GIT_PARAMS`
- **post-checkout** (runs on `git checkout` -- optional, but useful)
  - `npx git-notify checkout $GIT_PARAMS`

At the time of writing, `git-notify checkout` is the only hook that uses the arguments (`$GIT_PARAMS`) passed to the git hook, but ideally you should always pass the arguments to `git-notify`, in case we'll need to use them in a later version.

See [githooks.com](https://githooks.com/) for more resources on the topic. Documentation for different approaches are welcome!

### Installing git-notify without npm

At this time, `git-notify` is a node-based project. While I recognize it could be useful in other types of projects (ruby, python, rust, etc...), cross-platform scripting sucks, and this project is not interested in solving those problems at this time.

However, the `git-notify` beviour has been implemented in other languages:

- **PHP**: [Captain Hook](https://github.com/captainhookphp/captainhook)

If you like this idea, feel free to steal it and implement your own version, and I'll add it here.

## Contributing

This project is open to contributions. For anything that would radically change the nature of the project or increase its maintenance burden, please open an issue first to discuss.

### Local development

This project is written in TypeScript and scaffolded using [tsdx](https://github.com/formium/tsdx).

To run TSDX, use:

```bash
yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.
